# Google-Clone
A functional Google clone made as a project for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming Class. 
This project is a clone of the search engine google. It was built from scratch with HTML and CSS and features full functionality, including a Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced search page. By using input names as GET requests, the application is able to redirect users to their searches on the actual google engine.
